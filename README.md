# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis-
This project focuses on examining global video game sales data. The dashboard includes a line chart that tracks yearly sales trends by genre, a bar chart highlighting the top-performing genres based on cumulative sales, and a treemap showcasing the annual rank distribution of games.

# Context
The Game Revenue Analysis project examines global video game sales data to identify trends, patterns, and key performance indicators across various genres, platforms, and years. The project is set against the backdrop of the gaming industry's rapid evolution, marked by technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and the emergence of new gaming platforms. The analysis explores historical sales data to understand how genres like Action, Sports, and Shooter have consistently outperformed others, while less popular genres like Strategy and Puzzle have maintained niche followings. The project also investigates peak sales periods in the late 2000s and early 2010s, a time of market expansion driven by blockbuster game releases and innovations. It aims to provide actionable insights for industry stakeholders by highlighting growth periods and market shifts.

# Results
The analysis reveals that the Action genre leads global sales, followed by Sports and Shooter genres, which together dominate the market. Peak sales years, particularly from 2006 to 2009, saw significant contributions from these genres, underscoring their popularity and profitability. The treemap visualization highlights annual rank distributions, with the most active years featuring a higher number of top-ranking games. Meanwhile, the line chart identifies a steady decline in sales in recent years, likely reflecting market saturation, the rise of digital-only gaming, or changing player preferences. The bar chart provides a clear comparison of cumulative sales across genres, showcasing the enduring dominance of Action games.
Overall, the project delivers a comprehensive understanding of the gaming market's evolution, helping researchers, industry professionals, and enthusiasts pinpoint key trends and derive actionable strategies. By hosting the dashboard on Tableau Public, it ensures accessibility and interactivity, allowing users to explore and leverage the data for further analysis and strategic decision-making.
